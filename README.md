## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Hooks: useEffect, useState.
- Communication through props.
- SASS for styles.
- 7-1 Sass patron arquitecture.
- Conventional Commits

### What I learned

This project has allowed me to deeply learn about props behavior in React.js. I applied communication through props to grant access to state variables between different tree components. This has given me a preliminary understanding as a first step toward using the Context API in the next stage.

### Useful resources

- [Concentional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - This helped me for understand how to make a efficient commits over the course of the proyect.
- [Sass architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/es/#arquitectura) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the pattern 7-1 architecture. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
